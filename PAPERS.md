# Agent Manifest Papers

Agent Manifest Papers is an ongoing series examining declarative governance in autonomous systems.

The series explores the architectural implications of undeclared authority, implicit mandate, and the necessity of declaration before execution.

These papers do not define implementation and do not modify the normative specification.  
They examine the structural conditions under which autonomous systems can operate with declared legitimacy.
