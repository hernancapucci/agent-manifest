# Agent Manifest Papers

Agent Manifest Papers is an ongoing series examining structural governance in autonomous systems.

The series explores the architectural implications of undeclared authority, implicit mandate, and the need for declaration before execution.

These papers do not define implementation.  
They examine the conditions under which autonomous systems can operate with structural legitimacy.
