# Governance

Agent Manifest is an open, declarative initiative intended to remain neutral,
minimal, and execution-agnostic.

This governance statement applies to the v1.x series of the specification.
Major version changes may redefine stewardship and governance structure.

## Origin

Agent Manifest was initially authored and published by:

**Hernán Alfredo Capucci**  
Initiator and founding author  
2026

## Stewardship

This repository does not enforce governance, ownership, or authority.

The initial author acts as a steward of the canonical v1.x documents,
with the sole intent of preserving conceptual clarity, scope boundaries,
and the non-executing nature of the manifest.

Canonical releases (e.g., v1.0) represent frozen specification states.
Future changes require version increments.

Future stewardship, forks, reinterpretations, or independent evolutions
are explicitly permitted and encouraged.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome via issues and pull requests.

There is no requirement for endorsement, alignment, or permission.
Any influence this repository has on external systems or designs
is voluntary and non-binding.
