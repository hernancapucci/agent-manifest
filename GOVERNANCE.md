# Governance

Agent Manifest is an open, declarative initiative intended to remain neutral,
minimal, and execution-agnostic.

## Origin

Agent Manifest was initially authored and published by:

**Hernán Alfredo Capucci**  
Initiator and founding author  
2026

## Stewardship

This repository does not enforce governance, ownership, or authority.

The initial author acts as a steward of the foundational documents,
with the sole intent of preserving conceptual clarity, scope boundaries,
and non-executing nature of the manifest.

Future stewardship, forks, reinterpretations, or independent evolutions
are explicitly permitted and encouraged.

Contributions are welcome via issues and pull requests.

There is no requirement for endorsement, alignment, or permission.
Any influence this repository has on external systems or designs
is voluntary and non-binding.
