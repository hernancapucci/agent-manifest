# Agent Manifest — Roadmap

## Current Phase

Agent Manifest is in its foundational stage.

The priority is conceptual clarity, structural minimalism, and architectural coherence.

This project does not optimize for rapid feature expansion.
It optimizes for long-term legitimacy and structural soundness.

---

## Phase I — Foundation

- Consolidate core specification (JSON Schema stability)
- Refine examples across different risk/autonomy profiles
- Document design rationale and philosophical grounding
- Maintain strict separation between doctrine and implementation

No enforcement mechanisms.
No runtime integrations.
No ecosystem expansion.

Stability over velocity.

---

## Phase II — Validation (Exploratory)

- Research lightweight validation tooling
- Explore schema linting utilities
- Collect structured feedback from early technical reviewers
- Evaluate real-world use cases

No commercial tooling.
No compliance frameworks.
No monetization strategy.

Observation before expansion.

---

## Phase III — Extension (Conditional)

Only after architectural maturity:

- Optional validation CLI
- Optional SDK references
- Optional integration patterns
- Optional registry concepts

Extensions will remain modular and non-intrusive.

The core specification will remain minimal.

---

## Design Principle

Agent Manifest does not grow by accumulation.
It grows by refinement.

Minimal surface area.
Maximum clarity.
Structural integrity before ecosystem scale.

---

## Long-Term View

If agent autonomy becomes structurally significant in digital infrastructure,
declarative authority frameworks will be necessary.

Agent Manifest positions itself as a foundational layer —
not a runtime, not a product, not a platform.

Architecture first.
Adoption second.
Monetization last.
