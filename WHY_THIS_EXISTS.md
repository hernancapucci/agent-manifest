# Why This Exists

Agent Manifest exists to solve a simple but increasingly critical problem:

As AI agents become more autonomous, composable, and networked, there is no neutral, shared way for an agent to publicly declare **who it is**, **what it intends**, and **what it will not do**.

Most existing approaches focus on:
- execution
- enforcement
- scoring
- policy
- control
- runtime behavior

Agent Manifest intentionally does **none** of those.

## The Gap

Today, agents can act before any clear declaration of:
- identity
- purpose
- constraints
- autonomy level
- risk boundaries
- data handling assumptions

This creates opacity by default.

Agent Manifest introduces a **declarative layer before interaction**, not after execution.

## What This Is

Agent Manifest is:
- open
- minimal
- execution-agnostic
- framework-independent
- protocol-neutral

It is designed to be read by:
- humans
- agents
- systems
- validators
- auditors

Without requiring trust in the runtime.

## What This Is Not

Agent Manifest does **not**:
- execute code
- validate behavior
- enforce rules
- score agents
- grant permissions
- make decisions

Those responsibilities belong elsewhere.

## The Intent

The intent is not control.

The intent is **clarity before action**.

Agent Manifest allows any agent to say, in advance:

> “This is who I am.  
> This is what I am for.  
> These are my limits.”

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

## Why Now

The need for declarations precedes:
- regulation
- institutions
- enforcement layers

Agent Manifest is intentionally small so it can:
- coexist with future systems
- be embedded anywhere
- remain stable as runtimes evolve

## A Primitive, Not a Platform

Agent Manifest is not a product.

It is a primitive.

A building block that others can adopt, ignore, extend, or reference.

Its value comes from being **simple enough to survive**.
