# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository hosts a specification and reference examples for the Agent Manifest.
While it is not an executable runtime, security and safety issues may still apply to:

- Misuse patterns enabled by the spec or examples
- Ambiguities that could lead to unsafe deployments
- Vulnerabilities in example integrations (if any)
- Documentation issues that could cause harmful misunderstandings

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security or safety-related concerns **privately**.

Use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** for this repository (Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability).

Do **not** open a public issue for:
- exploitable misuse patterns
- unsafe “how-to” instructions
- issues involving private data, credentials, or access

## What to Include

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Where it appears (file path / section / example)
- A minimal reproduction or scenario
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Response Expectations

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within **7 days**
- Provide an initial assessment within **14 days**
- Publish a fix or clarification when appropriate

Thank you for helping improve the safety and clarity of this work.
