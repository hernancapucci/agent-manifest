# What This Is

This repository contains the Agent Manifest.

It is a declaration.
Not a framework.
Not a product.
Not a system.

It defines a minimal conceptual boundary for what an agent is allowed to be.

## What This Is

Agent Manifest is a shared reference.

It exists to articulate:
- intent
- scope
- limits

It provides a stable point of orientation for anyone designing, reasoning about, or governing autonomous or semi-autonomous agents.

It does not prescribe behavior.
It does not enforce compliance.
It does not depend on any technology stack.

---

## What This Is Not

This is not a technical specification.

It is not:
- an implementation guide
- a protocol
- a business proposal
- a marketing document

Any implementation inspired by this document is intentionally out of scope.

---

## How To Use This

You may:
- read it
- reference it
- disagree with it
- extend it

You do not need permission.

If this document influences how you design, govern, or reason about agents,
that influence is voluntary.

## Final Note

This repository does not aim to be finished.

It aims to be foundational.
