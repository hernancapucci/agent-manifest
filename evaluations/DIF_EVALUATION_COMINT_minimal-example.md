# DIF Evaluation — Minimal Example (Summary)

This document summarizes the Declarative Integrity Framework (DIF)
assessment of the Minimal Example Agent Manifest.

## Verdict

PASS — Declaratively coherent baseline example.

## Observations

- Required declaration fields are present.
- Autonomy level (1) is consistent with low risk posture.
- Stopping authority is declared and structurally sufficient.
- Audit posture is minimal but acceptable for low-risk usage.
- Data handling declaration is clear (no personal data stored).

## Notes

This evaluation assesses declarative coherence only.
It does not enforce runtime guarantees.
It does not modify the normative specification.
